# TELEGRAM SCRAPPER
Scraping Telegram members and adding them to your group/discussion, or channel. It also has a scraping text file from any public group or channel. It is good for grabbing a combolist, but it leaked? Sheesh.

## Installation
• Cloning the repository to your download folder
cd storage; cd downloads; git clone https://github.com/sintxcs/tgscrap
• Run the script
cd tgscrap; python tgscrap.sin
## Steps
Setting up your api_id & api_hash
<br>First, you need to log in to [my.telegram.org/app](https://my.telegram.org/apps) (preferably to use an extra account, not your main account)

Step 2
<br>Copy your api_id & api_hash

Step 3
<br>Run the script file python tgscrap.sin`` — input 1 and details you grab and ready to go!

## Modified Version has:
<br>- Applicable timeout (60 minutes) if getting flood error.
<br>- Skipping the username/uid of the members if they are already members.
<br>- New options: txt file scrapping— good for logging combolist.
<br>- Adding members to the channel is also added (for testing)
<br>- It also has a new feature. Just input the link/username of the target group without listing it.
<br>- merging all script files into one file.
<br>- clean interface.
